# TMgen: Traffic Matrix generation tool

TMgen is a tool for generating spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal traffic
matrices. Generation is based on the Max Entropy model described in
**Spatiotemporal Traffic Matrix Synthesis** by Paul Tune and Matthew Roughan,
published in ACM SIGCOMM 2015.

Other, simple models (e.g., uniform, gravity) are also implemented for
convenience.

## Supported TM models

- [x] Random Gravity Model
- [x] Modulated Random Gravity Model
- [x] Non-stationary Conditionally Independent Model
- [x] Spike Model
- [x] Gravity Model
- [x] Uniform Model

## Installation

1. Install numpy and cython. (For example using `pip install numpy cython`)
2. Run ``pip install .``

## Example Usage

See http://tmgen.readthedocs.io/ for the docs.

## Big Thanks
To Paul Tune, Matthew Roughan, and Ari Pakman for their work in this space and
for making their code available. This code is an adaptation of their Matlab
versions [MaxEnt](https://github.com/ptuls/MaxEntTM) and
[HMC](https://github.com/aripakman/hmc-tmg)
